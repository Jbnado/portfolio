    "title": "About Me",
    "intro": "I'm a fullstack developer with 4 years of experience building web applications that make a difference. I've worked at marketing (Authorify, US), B2B e-commerce (Take), and fintech (Verzel) companies. My journey started with curiosity — taking things apart to understand how they work — and evolved into a passion for creating complete solutions, from backend to the final pixel.",
    "philosophy": "I believe good software is invisible: it loads fast, is intuitive, and accessible to everyone. Every line of code I write has a purpose — solving a real problem, not impressing with unnecessary complexity.",
    "approach": "My approach combines fullstack vision with attention to detail. I work with React on the frontend and Java/Python/NestJS on the backend, deploying to the cloud with AWS and Docker. Outside of code, I co-founded RP.js — a JavaScript community in Ribeirão Preto — and developed Ribeirão Noir, an investigative game launched at the Book Fair and validated by 3 PhD academics."
